Build a fullstack web app with both frontend and backend. Use React with JSX, Tailwind CSS, React hooks, and Lucide React icons. Design must be beautiful, responsive, and production-readyâ€”avoid cookie-cutter layouts.

Frontend must include:

Clean component structure

Professional, modern UI using Tailwind

Lucide React icons for all iconography (no external UI libraries unless necessary)

Backend must include:

RESTful or RPC-style API (preferably Node.js/Express or Supabase Edge Functions)

Connected to a database (MongoDB or Supabase)

Ensure the frontend fetches and displays data from the backend. All components and logic should be built cleanly and professionally with scalability in mind. Avoid generic or lazy solutions.
